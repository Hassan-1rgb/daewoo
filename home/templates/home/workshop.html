        <h4>Vehicle Inspection / Fitness System</h4>
        <p>To maintain roadworthy buses, technical teams monitor 18 site workshops & 4 mobile workshops fully equipped with latest tools. Maintenance follows manufacturer rules and categorized maintenance types.</p>

        <h4>General Maintenance</h4>
        <p>Pre-departure and after-arrival inspections include Pit Inspection & Wash Service.</p>

        <h4>Pit Inspection</h4>
        <p>Foreman checks engine, oil, water, brakes, tyres, A/V system and rectifies defects noted on crew comment papers.</p>

        <h4>Wash Service</h4>
